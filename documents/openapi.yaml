    # About Us
      **The Sequoia Humane Society** is a non-profit with the mission of providing shelter and humane care for animals. We work vigorously to reduce the tragedy of euthanasia caused by too many animals, and not enough homes. Our goals are to promote the welfare of all animals, prevent cruelty and suffering of animals, end the overpopulation of cats and dogs, keep animals with homes from becoming homeless, and find homes for all adoptable animals.<br></br>
      To achieve this, we've developed the **AI-Powered Pet Matchmaker**. This innovative tool streamlines the pet adoption process by intelligently matching potential adopters with compatible animals. Our algorithms consider various factors, including an adopter's lifestyle, living situation, experience level, and preferences, to ensure the best possible fit.<br></br>
      This document serves as a comprehensive guide to our **REST APIs**, detailing the requests and responses necessary for seamless communication, particularly with our `React` frontend. Our goal is to provide developers with a clear understanding of all integration points, facilitating efficient and effective development.<br></br>
    # Prerequistes
    **Node.js** >= **20.16.0** and **npm** >= **10.8.2** are the minimum required versions that this API runs on, but we always recommend using the latest version of Node.js.<br></br>
    # Images storage
    Our API leverages **AWS S3** for efficient and scalable storage of all image content. For guidance on setting up and utilizing AWS S3, please refer to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQAIojcArRY&t=996s" target="_blank">this video tutorial</a>
