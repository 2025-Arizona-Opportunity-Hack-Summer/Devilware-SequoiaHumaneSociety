## Project Overview

### Inspiration

One of the biggest hurdles in finding a compatible pet for everyone is considering various factors and living situations that each person has, and finding the right pet for them.

We realized that while various adoption platforms has introduced a wide array of methods to help improve compatibility, they often tend to focus on basic filters, and don't take into account contexts such as personality, living situations or disabilities.

### What it does

The platform uses a smart AI-powered system to help you find the best match possible - based on your lifestyle, preferences and needs.

Users begin by answering a series of questions touching on various topics such as schedule, housing situations, routine, and personal needs. Using this information, our system picks out adoptable animals from local shelters using a custom-trained compatibility model.

Users can further narrow down their preferences - such as choosing certain kind of pets or breeds. Our system picks out what appears to be the most compatible and suggest based on the information you have given.

The goal is to reduce mismatches, lower return rates and create long-lasting, happy adoptions.

## Team reflections

### Challenges we ran into

One major hurdle for us was coordination, as when we started many of us were out of country - this leads to timezone mismatches, which made meetings and cooperation rather difficult.

We also had to think about balancing technical implementation with user experience as well as accessibility, and ensuring the matches fit with various individuals. Effective communications between team members working on different branches was difficult, but taught us a lot.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

After two months of planning, developing, and testing, we are extremely proud of our application. Here are our proudest accomplishments:

- We successfully launched the site, which features a functional pet recommendation engine. We made something that centers empathy and accessibility, ensuring that people from various lifestyles can find the right pet.
- Our team comprises of individuals with diverse backgrounds, and we effectively leveraged each otherâ€™s expertise to create a comprehensive application. We committed ourselves fully from start to finish.
- We have an amazing document. Developers can easily run our website on their computers, making website improvements smoother.

### What we learned

- We learned a lot about the React framework, the Express framework, and AI models, as well as how to connect them into one application.
- We also learned how to create useful documentation so that developers can understand how to run and use it effectively.
- Good projects don't start and end at code - it's about empathy, problem solving, effective team coordination and understanding various needs.
- How to break down large tasks and build something shippable from day 0, with realistic time frames.
- The success of an app or software depends not only on the quality of the code but also on planning, testing, and suggestions. Without the significant help of mentors, we would not have been able to develop our application to be this successful.
- It is fine to not know everything right away - helping and learning is how we improve: as coders, as people.

BUCKET_NAME=bucket_name
BUCKET_REGION=us
BUCKET_ACCESS_KEY=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
BUCKET_SECRET_KEY=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

```

#### Amazon S3 Bucket

[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) stores data as objects within buckets. An object is a file and any metadata that describes the file. A bucket is a container for objects. To store your data in Amazon S3, you first create a bucket and specify a bucket name and AWS Region. Then, you upload your data to that bucket as objects in Amazon S3. Each object has a key (or key name), which is the unique identifier for the object within the bucket.

In this project specially, we use Amazon S3 Bucket to store pet's images. See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQAIojcArRY&t=2079s) to understand how to set up and use the bucket to store images.

### AI Model â€” Local Invocation

Our compatibility model lives on **Vertex AI AutoML Tabular**. Choose either route:

---

#### A. Call the Hosted Endpoint (recommended)

```bash
# 1) Authenticate once
gcloud auth application-default login

# 2) Export env vars
export PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project
export REGION=us-central1  # adjust if needed
export ENDPOINT_ID=123456789012  # Vertex AI endpoint id

# 3) Run prediction helper
cd Devilware-SequoiaHumaneSociety/ai-client
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python predict.py \
  --project "$PROJECT_ID" \
  --region "$REGION" \
  --endpoint_id "$ENDPOINT_ID" \
  --instances example_instances.json
```

---

#### B. Offline Docker Container

1. **Export** the model from Vertex AI as a Docker image and extract it to `ai-model/offline/`
2. **Build & run** the container:

```bash
cd ai-model/offline
docker build -t petmatcher-model .
docker run -p 8080:8080 petmatcher-model
```

---

#### 3. Query the Local Server

Once your Docker container is running, you can query the model locally using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/models/petmatcher:predict \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"instances": [{"age": 25, "housing": "Apartment"}]}'
```

---

#### Helper Directory Layout

```
ai-client/
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt   # google-cloud-aiplatform, python-dotenv â€¦
â”œâ”€â”€ predict.py         # Vertex endpoint wrapper
â””â”€â”€ example_instances.json
