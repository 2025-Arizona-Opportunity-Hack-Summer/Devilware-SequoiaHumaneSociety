### Prerequistes

- git, any version
- **Node.js >= 20.16.0** and **npm >= 10.8.2** are the minimum required versions that this repo runs on, but we always recommend using the latest version of Node.js.

### Frontend Application `/matchmaker-app`

This section details the installation, running, and environment configurations of the `/matchmaker-app` directory, which houses our entire client-side application.

BUCKET_SECRET_KEY=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

#### Amazon S3 Bucket

[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) stores data as objects within buckets. An object is a file and any metadata that describes the file. A bucket is a container for objects. To store your data in Amazon S3, you first create a bucket and specify a bucket name and AWS Region. Then, you upload your data to that bucket as objects in Amazon S3. Each object has a key (or key name), which is the unique identifier for the object within the bucket.

In this project specially, we use Amazon S3 Bucket to store pet's images. See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQAIojcArRY&t=2079s) to understand how to use the bucket to store images.
